# User Workspace

## Project Overview

User Workspace is a web application built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB that provides a backend framework for handling user authentication, payment processing, and integrations with e-commerce platforms like Shopee. The application employs a RESTful API architecture, ensuring a smoother experience for the client-side applications consuming the API. 

## Installation

To set up this project on your local machine, follow these instructions:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd user-workspace
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   Ensure you have **Node.js** installed (> 14). Run the following command to install the required npm packages:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and set your MongoDB connection string:
   ```env
   DB_URI=<your_mongodb_connection_string>
   PORT=8000
   ```

4. **Run the application:**
   Start the server using the command:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

Once the server is running, you can access the following API endpoints:

- **Authentication:**
  - `POST /api/auth/login` - log in a user.
  - `POST /api/auth/register` - register a new user.

- **Payments:**
  - `POST /api/payments/create` - create a new payment.
  - `GET /api/payments/history` - retrieve payment history.

- **Shopee Integration:**
  - `GET /api/shopee/products` - get products from Shopee.

### Example Request

To register a new user, send a POST request to `/api/auth/register` with a JSON payload containing the required fields (e.g., username, password).

```json
{
  "username": "exampleUser",
  "password": "examplePass"
}
```

## Features
